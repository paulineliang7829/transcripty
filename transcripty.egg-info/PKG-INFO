Description: 
        Transcripty is a package for replicating section 2 of _How risky is college
        investment_ by Lutz Hendricks and Oksana Leukhina.
        
        Section 2 presents a model of college credit accumulation. The probability
        that a student passes a particular course is governed by a probability
        that is conditional on a student's innate ability.
        
        - A student's ability given by `a \sim N(0, 1)`
        - A student's GPA given by `GPA = a + \varepsilon`  where  `\varepsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2)`
        - A student enrolls in 12 courses per year which are each worth 3 credits
        - A student passes each course with probability p(a)
        - Student graduates if they accumulate 125 credits by the end of year 6
